# Priority-Queue-Runtime-Comparison
This final project for a class on data structures implemented a priority queue in three different ways - as a linked list, as a minheap, and as a STL priority queue. It then analyzed the run-time of each implementation in enqueuing and dequeing to see which ran the fastest.
